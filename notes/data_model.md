# Data Model

_\[可以把信息以一种形式储存在电脑里的一些模型\]_

\[TOC\]

## Object based logical Models 「基于对象」

_\[Describe data at the conceptual and view levels\]_

### E-R Model

entities, attributes, relationship key constraint and participation constraint, weak entity

### Object oriented Model

## Record based logical Models 「基于记录/实例」

\[Like Object based model, they also describe data at the conceptual and view levels. These models specify logical structure of database with records, fields and attributes.\]

### \[Relational Model\]

-&gt; Translate conceptual \(ER\) into logical & physical design

-&gt; Understand integrity constraints

-&gt; Use DDL of SQL to create tables with constraints

### Hierarchical Model

\[a tree-based structure, allows each record to have more than one parent record\]

### Network Model

\[graph-like structure, 其他和Hierarchical Model一样\]

## Physical Data Models

\[These models describe data at the lowest level of abstraction\]
